No this is not a post about Rails development or production environments. This is a post about your vacation environment.

In the last couple of months I took 2 vacation trips: one to Budapest and another one to Amsterdam.

Before the first one I was thinking about should I carry my laptop with me or not. I was going to Budapest with my girlfriend for 6 days, renting a small AirBnb in the center of the city. My pros were somewhere along the lines of: we're gonna be in the train for 6 or more hours, maybe it would be cool to watch a movie in the train. Or maybe on our day off from sightseeing. Or maybe if we need to check out some cool bars near us.

I decided that the pros for carrying the laptop on a trip were just BS. The pros didn't overweight the cons: stress and getting I would have to think about not wrecking or losing it somewhere, wouldn't be able to take a nap on the train easily and it would be extra baggage.

I sometimes miss the days when I didn't have to take care about all the hundreds or thousands of euros I carry everyday in my pockets or on my back.

Although none of the money I make as a web developer wouldn't be possible without my laptop and a internet connection, I believe non of it would be possible without proper rest. My suggestion would be:

*Go on vacations when you feel like it, even more often than that, explore new places and get yourself out of the ordinary.*

You'll come back fresh to the office with lots of stories to tell and you'll hear all the latest stuff you've missed out while abroad.
